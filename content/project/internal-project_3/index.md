title: Interest Points Detection on 3D Meshes Using Harris Operator
summary:  In this project, an adaptive technique was implemented to determine interest points or 3D objects based on Harris operator which is done by determining neighborhood of a vertex over which Harris response on that is calculated. Steps- 1) For each vertex of mesh, forming a region of interest and it’s K neighborhood rings where all the rings are set of points, 2) Finding harris response, 3) Getting initial interest points, 4) Getting final interest points (either by selection fraction method or by clustering), 5) 3D rendering, and 6) Designing graphical user interface.
