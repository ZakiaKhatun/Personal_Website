# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The main aim of this project was improving the accuracy of automatic Left ventricular (LV) segmentation in short axis cardiac cine MR images. Steps- 1) Quantifying motion to determine an initial region of interest surrounding the heart, 2) Identifying potential 2D objects of interest using an intensity-based segmentation, 3)Assessing contraction/expansion, circularity, and proximity to lung tissue to score all objects of interest in terms of their likelihood of constituting part of the LV, and 4) Aggregating the objects into connected groups and construct the final LV blood pool volume and centroid.
