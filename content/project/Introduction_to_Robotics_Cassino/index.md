# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The purpose of this project was to design an Inverse Kinematic controller for Kinova Jaco2 robot following some given tasks. Task1- The control objective is position only without exploiting the redundancy. Task2- the control objective is given by both the position and the orientation. While the position needs to move according to the indications above, the orientation needs to be controlled such that it is kept constant at the initial value. Task3- The end-effector orientation needs to be changed. Task4- The redundancy needs to be exploited by maximizing the manipulability.
