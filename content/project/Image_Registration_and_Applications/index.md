# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This project aims to register 3D CT lung images which was tested on first 4 cases available on 4DCT DIR-Lab Challenge. Where, data is available with 300 landmark annotations. Evaluation is made using TRE 3D Euclidean distance between transformed landmarks.
