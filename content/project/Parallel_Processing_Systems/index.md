# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This project proposes a discrete image reconstruction algorithm using parallel beam geometry where a set of X-ray beams are passed through the object of interest and intensity variations of the beams at input and output are measured. To reconstruct, filtered back projection is used which uses a 1D filter on the projection data before back projecting (2D or 3D) the data onto the image space.
